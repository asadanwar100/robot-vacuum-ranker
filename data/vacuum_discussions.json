    "title": "Vacuum Wars Review of the eufy E28 Robot Vacuum Mop Combo with a SPOT Cleaner!",
    "selftext": "Hey everyone,  \nWe’ve been testing the new **eufy E28** robot vacuum for a few weeks now, and wanted to give r/robotvacuums an early look before our full video review goes live in a couple weeks. The E28 is one of the more unusual robots we’ve tested—it's not only a solid vacuum/mop combo, but it also converts into a **handheld spot cleaner**, making it potentially very appealing to pet owners or anyone who deals with carpet messes regularly.\n\n# Dual-Purpose Design: Robot + Spot Cleaner\n\nWhat really sets the E28 apart is that it doubles as a carpet spot-cleaning machine. The clean and dirty water tanks used for mopping can be detached, revealing a hose and nozzle (complete with a brush and trigger), allowing you to use it like a traditional spot cleaner. For me, as someone with two cats who treat the rug like a personal science experiment, that’s a compelling feature.\n\nIt works similarly to other spot cleaners—squeeze the trigger to spray, agitate with the brush, and vacuum the mess up. **And since the device is already pre-filled and sitting in the room, it's far more likely to be used than a full-size spot cleaner that lives in a closet.** There's even a handy self-cleaning button that flushes the hose, making cleanup easy.\n\nIn our tests, the spot cleaner's suction was a bit below average overall (40\" compared to 55\" avg), but still stronger than the best-selling Bissell Little Green (39\"). And it handled pretreated dried-on coffee and grape juice stains surprisingly well.\n\n# Vacuum Performance\n\nWhen used as a robot vacuum, the E28 performed impressively. It handled debris of all sizes—fine dust to XL particles—on both hard floors and carpet with ease. It even includes an auto-extending side brush for improved edge cleaning. In our carpet deep clean test, it scored 85%, well above the 75% average and among the top 8 out of more than 150 robots we've tested.\n\nObstacle avoidance was another strong point. The E28 uses a front camera and multiple sensors and scored 23 out of 24 in our avoidance tests—one of the highest scores we’ve seen. Eufy has consistently been strong in this category, and the E28 continues that trend.\n\nNavigation was also above average thanks to its top-mounted LiDAR (which we generally prefer over internal LiDAR systems). It was efficient and thorough in mapping and cleaning.\n\n# Mopping System\n\nThe E28’s mopping setup uses a **roller-style mop** rather than the more common spinning pads. That’s significant because it allows the E28 to actually suck up small liquid spills into its onboard dirty water tank—something pad-based robots can’t do. In our dried-on stain test, it performed well above average, though it did leave behind more water than we’d like (1.3g), regardless of water level settings in the app. That means it’s a bit more prone to streaking, but the cleaning power was excellent.\n\nThe mop lifts 10.5mm when carpets are detected, and you can set it to avoid carpets altogether or clean them before mopping.\n\n# Dock and App Experience\n\nThe auto-empty dock is solid. It empties debris into a bag, washes the mop roller with cold water, drains the dirty water, refills the tank, and finishes off with hot air drying. The only thing missing is hot water washing, which some flagship docks now include.\n\nThe app is user-friendly and well-featured—virtual barriers, multi-level maps, bin behavior customization, obstacle sensitivity, and more. Both the iOS and Android versions have high ratings.\n\n# A Few Weak Spots\n\nNow for the potential deal-breaker: long hair. The E28 has a newly designed dual-part brush that does a good job avoiding tangles with regular pet hair, but in our 7-inch hair test, it failed dramatically. Hair gathered behind the brush in dense clumps we called “hair cigars”—the worst score we’ve recorded for that test. We re-ran the test and got the same result. It might be a fluke, but if you have long hair in your home, it’s worth noting.\n\nThere were also a few minor drawbacks:\n\n* Suction and airflow were a bit underwhelming for its price point.\n* The onboard dustbin is small at 300mL.\n* If you use the spot cleaner heavily, the hose and nozzle components may wear out faster than the rest of the robot—and it’s unclear how easy they’ll be to replace.\n\nBattery life was average. While efficiency was slightly below par in raw tests, the E28’s navigational smarts helped it cover around 1,200 sq. ft. per charge.\n\n# Final Verdict\n\nThe E28 made it into the [Vacuum Wars Top 20 list,](https://vacuumwars.com/vacuum-wars-best-robot-vacuums/) currently sitting at #15 with a **score of 3.86 stars** (vs. the average of 2.8). It’s a solid robot vacuum and a decent mop, with **top-tier obstacle avoidance** and a **dock that nearly does it all**. The spot cleaner feature is genuinely innovative, and for some people, it might be a game changer.\n\nBut if you have long hair in the house, or you’re picky about streaking on hard floors, it might not be the ideal fit.\n\nCurious if anyone here has picked one up yet—or experienced the same hair clumping issues",

I have nothing negative to say about it, and highly recommend it. As I continued to learn from other reviewers how important having LiDAR navigation was,  I literally canceled two prior orders for competing robot vacuums without LiDAR before deciding on the Curv.\n\nIt does an excellent job of cleaning and moping. I have long hair that wraps around my conventional vacuum rollers, but the Curv's rollers don't accumulate it.  It mapped our home and the software is easy to use. My husband set a schedule for it. I tend to use the immediate \"zone cleaning\" feature so I can clear a path for it, make sure doors are open, etc.  Like other vacuums, if it finds a thin cord, it will drag it around, but that's only happened once and it didn't harm the cord. Maintenance is easy, you're basically just emptying out the dirty water after it mops. Its low profile goes under most furniture, and watching it navigate the floor around our dining room chairs is kind of amazing.\n\nTLDR: I never intended to spend this much on a vacuum, but my floors have never been cleaner!",

Does the price justify the extra functions and gadgets? Anyone who tried both or know something?\n\nOr even the L40 ultra that is also on sale for around 655 euro?\n\nSuch a jungle to figure this out.\n\nBasically 50-80 sq m hardwood floor with one or two carpets.

It has excellent vacuuming and mopping ability and a nicely automated dock that will not disappoint you. What it skips are all the gimics that cost a lot of money but do not contribute to a cleaner home. It is currently going for $800. You will love it!\n\nI cannot recommend any other model in the Qrevo lineup right now because of what comes next.\n\nAvoid anything with a auto detangling rollers. None of them from any manufacturer vacuum clean very well. The older style dual counter rotating rollers do need about two minutes per week of maintenance, but they vacuum clean so very much better!!!\n\nDon't buy into high pascal suction numbers. It is pure marketing hype! Airflow is what counts. It is what moves debris kicked up by the rollers into the dustbin. Good airflow means poor vacuum pressure, or much lower pascal suction numbers. It also means much better vacuuming ability. Anything with auto detanglers has bad airflow. \n\nAirflow and good rollers are key!\n\nI hope this helps!",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI recently bought a brand new Xiaomi X20+ vacuum mop from abroad at a great price. Unfortunately, as soon as I set it up, it wouldn’t mop ( only vacuum). I kept getting the frustrating error:\n“Dirty water tank is full” — even though the tank was completely empty and correctly placed.\n\nAfter trying all the obvious solutions with no success, I decided to dive deeper. I unscrewed the vacuum base station and started investigating.\n\nLong story short: After two days of trial and error, I discovered a hidden sensor that checks whether the dirty water tank is full. It turns out this sensor was falsely triggering the error.\nTo fix it, I cut and reconnected the two wires (green and grey) responsible for closing the voltage circuit that controls the sensor. Once I did that, the error disappeared and the device started working perfectly!\n\n I’ve included photos showing the sensor’s location and exactly which wires I modified in case it helps anyone else facing the same issue.\n\nJust wanted to share this with the community after spending two full days troubleshooting. Hope it saves someone the headache!",

    "selftext": "Just wanted to share my experience in case anyone’s thinking about buying a Yeedi vacuum.\n\nI bought one of their “fancy” models in October 2023—$700, did both vacuuming and mopping. For the first several months it worked *okay* (not perfect, but fine enough). Then recently, the main brush motor stopped working. Now instead of cleaning, it literally *spreads dirt* around my house. Awesome.\n\nSo I contacted Yeedi support thinking maybe it was a simple fix or a replaceable part. Nope. They told me:\n\n* They **don’t repair** their vacuums.\n* They **don’t sell** internal parts like the motor.\n* My **warranty just expired** (barely).\n* Their solution? \"Here’s 15% off our new model :)\"\n\nLike... what? You sell a $700 product with no way to repair it when a core part fails under a year later, and your idea of support is to upsell me a new one that is $800? Also, the model I bought is no longer listed on Amazon—probably pulled to bury the bad reviews.\n\nHonestly, I feel scammed. This thing is basically e-waste now, and I will never buy another product from them again. Just wanted to warn others before they make the same expensive mistake.\n\nIf anyone has recommendations for a *reliable* robot vacuum brand that actually offers long-term support and replacement parts, I’m all ears.",

    "selftext": "I had never used a robot vacuum before, and honestly, I was a bit worried it might be complicated. But after receiving it, I followed the tutorial and got it assembled in no time. Connecting it to Wi-Fi was also smooth — every step came with a voice prompt, which is really user-friendly for a newbie like me.\n\nWe have a ginger cat, and before mapping, the robot asked whether there were any pets in the house and reminded me to pick up any small items from the floor. Our home isn’t that big, but we have quite a few rooms. I thought it would have to roam through every corner to get a proper scan, but surprisingly, it only took a quick loop around each room to complete the mapping.\n\nI don’t want to sound overly dramatic, but honestly — wow! It picked up all the food crumbs and spills left behind by my son and cat. I used to get down on my hands and knees with a cloth to scrub those dried spots. But E25 handled it all in one go. The mopping function is genuinely impressive.\n\n**Now, a few things I think could be improved (though maybe they’re not really problems. Sorry, I’m still new to robot vacuum):**\n\nThe noise from the auto-emptying base is a bit loud, but the vacuum itself runs really quietly. I’ve now scheduled it to clean in the mornings when no one's home, which works perfectly.\n\nOur place is probably a maze to the robot, but it managed to avoid most obstacles like toys, chairs, and slippers. It did roll over a cable once though. I contacted eufy, they explained that the robot has an AI learning process, and over time, it will get better at avoiding things. So I’m planning to keep an eye on how it improves with use.",

The image recognition model has a few hundred common items that it can recognise and avoid, but Eufy have said they're going to update the model with additional items in future as part of their software/firmware updates for the device.

After lugging it home I unboxed and setup in 10 minutes. I was a it worried about the setup but a combination of verbal prompts and app made it extremely easy to get going. I basically took the vanilla option and let it do its own thing except vacuum then mop. \n\nThe first clean was crazy watching it find its way around was frustrating. It got stuck under the tv cabinet about half way through which i got alerted and had to fetch it out , started to think here we go. It needed to return and got stuck trying to find a way past some obstacles through a wall. I left it and eventually it turned around and decided to try a different way…. Hmmm the thing can think. It had trouble mapping a clothes horse i had in one room , much to our amusement we watched it literally jump both legs… Hmm the things got some power legs as well. After about two hours it finally finished finding its way into areas I didn’t think it would even go. After the first vacuum then map was set.\n\nSecond pass mop was so much smoother and seemed to go via a plan the mopping was quiet and pretty damn good . The robot really seemed to know its way now and did it with ease.\n\nLikes :\nMopping performance is amazing\nSuper smart mapping and obstacle avoidance\nSetup was so super easy\nApp is really simple to use. Ive added information to all the rooms now and can get it to do a variety of tasks with words “Hey Mova”\nPet Photos, Photos of obstacles , real time\nQuiet in all modes except disposing of rubbish but still not so bad\n\nDislikes\nNo Home Assistant integration….Grrrrr!\nWidget on phone doesn’t work\nBags and detergent plus all the other proprietary disposables !\nVacuum is ok but not great, saying that after a few passes its looking much better \nThe thing is chatty its like having a new wife but no off switch i can find\n\nConcerns :\nAre the Chinese government watching me?\n\nOverall im loving this thing my life seems easier and I’ve almost forgotten it’s there enjoying my fresh floors.",

When mapping the new place, the unit determined that everything - living room, kitchen, hallway, etc was all one big room.

I see I can set up Zones in the app but I'm confused how they work - they seem to be inclusive, meaning \"clean this area only,\" not exclusive as in \"do not clean here.\"\n\nIt's also possible I'm over-thinking, I did the mapping before we moved any furniture in at all - I literally moved the robot vacuum over and told it to map.

After lugging it home I unboxed and setup in 10 minutes. I was a it worried about the setup but a combination of verbal prompts and app made it extremely easy to get going. I basically took the vanilla option and let it do its own thing except vacuum then mop. \n\nThe first clean was crazy watching it find its way around was frustrating. It got stuck under the tv cabinet about half way through which i got alerted and had to fetch it out , started to think here we go. It needed to return and got stuck trying to find a way past some obstacles through a wall. I left it and eventually it turned around and decided to try a different way…. Hmmm the thing can think. It had trouble mapping a clothes horse i had in one room , much to our amusement we watched it literally jump both legs… Hmm the things got some power legs as well. After about two hours it finally finished finding its way into areas I didn’t think it would even go. After the first vacuum then map was set.\n\nSecond pass mop was so much smoother and seemed to go via a plan the mopping was quiet and pretty damn good . The robot really seemed to know its way now and did it with ease.\n\nLikes :\nMopping performance is amazing\nSuper smart mapping and obstacle avoidance\nSetup was so super easy\nApp is really simple to use. Ive added information to all the rooms now and can get it to do a variety of tasks with words “Hey Mova”\nPet Photos, Photos of obstacles , real time\nQuiet in all modes except disposing of rubbish but still not so bad\n\nDislikes\nNo Home Assistant integration….Grrrrr!\nWidget on phone doesn’t work\nBags and detergent plus all the other proprietary disposables !\nVacuum is ok but not great, saying that after a few passes its looking much better \nThe thing is chatty its like having a new wife but no off switch i can find\n\nConcerns :\nAre the Chinese government watching me?\n\nOverall im loving this thing my life seems easier and I’ve almost forgotten it’s there enjoying my fresh floors.",

And the ultra vision has the mopping and self emptying, but from what I could find seems to be a lesser brand in terms of app and reliability. \n\nWhich one would you go with? Thanks",

    "selftext": "After several weeks of testing, I can say I’m extremely satisfied with the Eufy E25. The robot vacuums quietly and efficiently, and the overall cleaning result leaves nothing to be desired. Compared to my X10 Pro Omni, the E25 is significantly quieter during operation, which I really appreciate in daily use.\n\nI’m deliberately comparing the E25 to the X10 Pro Omni, since I see the E25 as its natural successor. Especially now that Eufy has clarified its product lines:\nWith the S-series for high-end models, the E-series for mid-range, and the C-series as entry-level \n\nIt’s clear that the E25 is positioned as the next step after the X10 Pro Omni in their lineup.\n\nOne of the standout features is the upgraded mopping system. The new high-pressure mopping roller works brilliantly and applies noticeably more pressure to the floor. It cleans thoroughly without being overly wet and uses very little water overall, which I find better managed than on the X10 Pro. The dual-part roller brush is also a great improvement. During my entire test, it didn’t pick up or wrap a single hair. Everything was properly suctioned and removed. That’s a big plus for households with pets or long hair.\n\nAnother highlight is the side brush that extends and reliably sweeps dirt even from deep corners. It adds real value to edge cleaning and ensures that no spots are left untouched.\n\nThe water tank is transparent, which makes it easy to check the water level at a glance. However, the small filling cap on the fresh water tank makes cleaning the tank itself more difficult compared to the larger opening on the X10 Pro Omni. It’s a minor trade-off, but still something to note.\n\nAs for design, the robot looks modern and clean, though the glossy surface picks up dust and fine scratches easily. Personally, I also prefer the hinged top cover from the X10 over the removable lid used here, since it felt sturdier and more user-friendly.\n\nFor future models, I’d love to see more consistency in interchangeable parts. Standardized consumables like dustbags, HEPA filters, and brushes across models would make things much easier. Especially for people like me who own multiple Eufy vacuums. And while I don’t mind using Eufy’s own cleaning solution, I’d prefer a refillable tank instead of a cartridge that needs to be repurchased.\n\nAll in all, the E25 has developed into a very strong and reliable product. It’s quiet, smart, and delivers excellent cleaning results both when vacuuming and mopping. I’m looking forward to using it long-term.\n\nIf you’ve got questions, feel free to ask.",

Only 1 piece, mind!\n• App isn’t letting me turn on the ‘auto dispense detergent’ 🤷🏻‍♂️\n\nOverall I’m very pleased, I took the risk of ordering from Amazon Italy (although it came from Spain) to the UK!\n\nAny questions I’ll try and answer!\n",

    "title": "How to buy a Robot vacuum",
    "selftext": "I started reading here when I was researching a new machine in November 2024 and have stuck around because it's interesting.  It seems this question comes up about 100x a day, so am taking the bold step of writing down my thoughts.    (I have nothing to do with the market as a dealer or influencer, and am just an ordinary homeowner with  pets and messy floors. :) )  \n\n* **Have realistic expectations.**\n   * Robots are an amazing tool and I will never be without one ever again - clean floors for the win! - but marketing hype seems to lead some to expect \"perfect\" vs \"reduces the amount of time I have to spend cleaning floors\".   \n   * These units deliver best result when run daily, or at least often.  \n   * You may still have to do a good mop and vac yourself at some point, particularly if you have  high standards for your floors.  These units work best as maintenance tools. That said, the developing technology is improving all the time, and they are now closer to being \"the only vac you need\".... if you are realistic.\n   * Sunken spaces and high thresholds remain a problem; some units can manage higher than others, but there are limits. Read the mfrs information regarding how high it can actually manage. \n* **ALL units need periodic maintenance.** \n   * No matter how much the manufacturer touts \"set it and forget it\", they are mechanical as well as electronic, and just like a car or a lawn mower, they need to occasionally be cleaned out and checked over. This is NOT a \"failure\" of the unit, but a reasonable expectation.\n* **Budget.** \n   * Figure out how much you can spend, which will automatically narrow the field.\n      * You no longer HAVE to spend a mortgage payment on a robot. Higher-priced options may offer more features or greater effectiveness, but last year's \"latest and greatest\" is now turning up in less expensive models, eg self filling, better roller brushes, better apps and scheduling etc.    I know some  here will disagree, but depending on your needs,  \"more expensive\" does not necessarily mean \"better\". \n* **What are your Must Haves?**\n   * **What kind of flooring are you cleaning**\n      * Tile, hardwood, vinyl, area rugs, wall-to-wall carpet? Most robots can handle them all BUT with a different degree of success, and this is an important factor. \n   * **Vac or Mop/vac?** \n      * The market seems to be moving to combo units and the price difference between mop vs no mop is no longer as significant. However, most units can run with vac, mop, or both, and you can usually switch the mop OFF if it is not a feature you need. \n   * **Mapping,  navigation, and object avoidance**\n      * Lidar and other laser methods seem to do the best job, and have become prevalent.\n      * \"Bump and turn\" is still found in super-budget models and is more effective than you might think, but it is slower and less efficient. Don't shy away from this is you are on a very tight budget, just know its limits in advance. \n      * Do you need maximum object avoidance? Some units are better at this than others. If you have lots of scattered toys or cables, go for object avoidance, but recognize that this also means the area around the obstacles won't get cleaned. \n      * Animal messes are still a risk no matter what any advertising tells you - if your pets leave presents, check the floor beforehand, and don't run the robot when you're out 😄\n   * **App**\n      * Brands have different degrees or granularity to the functions, although most offer time scheduling and specific functions\n      * Some brands have outright BAD apps (Shark, looking at you......) - look at the app screenshots and features when you're researching, and check for user reports of contstant freezing and crashing. Note that some units still require a 2.4ghz connection.\n   * **Suction**\n      * high Pa numbers are NOT the whole story!  Most robots now have decent suction and multiple levels from ultraquiet to superturbo, but it's not only about that, but HOW the robot moves debris to where it gets sucked up. This is why side brushes, roller location, and other variables matter too and why some \"high suction models\" er, suck, and others with lower numbers can be highly efficient. \n   * **Base station**\n      * The market is moving towards this, and having had both a straight up recharger and self-empty, I'd go for the self-empty/self-fill  EVERY time.  They just work.\n      * Base station footprint. Some of the new models are BIG - be sure you have space for it both physically and aesthetically.  \n   * **Roller brush/detangling**\n      * does it have some kind of detangling vs an ordinary bristle brush?\n      * What kind of detangling does it use (rubber fins/bigger roller, cutting comb, split roller etc). There are different methods of varying success, depending on what kind of flooring and mess you are cleaning. It's not necessarily a \"one size fits all\" element.\n      * Does it clean the ends where the roller is housed or just the brush? (This was HUGE for us as long haired people and animals)\n      * What kind of debris are you managing?  While most robots do \"ok\" with all of these, some are better at certain ones and your needs may affect your choice, eg short animal fur (cats/short haired dogs), kitty litter, long hair, leaves\n   * **Mopping functions**\n      * There are different kinds: passive mops (basically a wet pad that runs across the floor) and active mopping (motion and downward pressure)\n      * Active mopping\n      * Roller (generally seen as the best currently)\n      * Spinning pads (I personally have one with this and think it does a great job!)\n      * Vibrating pads (some rate them highly)\n   * **Where does the water come from?**\n      * Some mops YOU have to add the water to the tank every time (often the case with passive mopping)\n      * others have base station clean water tank to wet the mop\n      * others have base station clean water tank that fills an onboard tank on the robot\n      * HIgh end ones sometimes have a connection to a water line so you don't have to fill the robot OR the base station\n      * Some units use it all up\n      * Some units clean the mopheads and drain the water into a dirty water tank\n      * Some units use a hose to drain into a drain\n   * **Does the robot wash/dry the mops?** \n      * some have changeable pads, but you have to remove and wash them\n      * some base stations wash the mop for you during the draining process\n      * some base stations also dry the mops to keep it from smelling. There are room temp and heated air dryers, depending on the model. \n* **New features**\n   * Seems mfrs are  moving at lightning speed to incorporate more and more, so newer flagship models are coming out with extendable brushese and mops for better edge cleaning, baseboard cleaning, ozone additions to keep the water smelling sweet etc etc.  These usually come with an increased price tag and may not have been in the market long enough to know how well they really work.\n* **Brands**\n   * SO MANY!!! It's hard, because a lot of tham are decent. However, after reading this sub for a while, here is what I've gathered on the readily-available brands in the US based on what people have posted in here. This is NOT a comprehensive list, just the ones I have either used myself or seen multiple posts about in this sub. \n      * Roomba: the 1st, with heavy brand recognition, but no longer necessarily the best in this market. \n      * Shark: great full size vacuums, not such great robots UNLESS you pick one up cheap somewhere (I have a Shark refurb I love, tbh - it's great on soft rugs because the suction IS on the low side).  The App is terrible, which is one of its big shortcomings. \n      * Eufy good range with focus on new and less-common features (eg first roller mop, hand vac attached to base station), and also well-featured budget-price models (I personally am a fan after having had three different models. Their email support is pretty good too).\n      * Roborock:  popular and often recommended in this sub\n      * Dreame/Mova: two branches of the same company with well-featured competitive models often recommended in this sub\n      * Ecovacs/Deebot: I believe these are available at Costco, so you get extra return/support through them. \n*  ",

I also live by myself so if I don't clean, no one will.\nUsually I'd clean every weekend or at least I try to lol which means no vacuuming/mopping during the week or over a week. I have 2 cats so their shedded fur, little pieces of litter and the food crumbs were always on the floor. they'll accumulate again after a day so I kinda closed one eye (or both 😂) and ignored them.... so y'all can understand why I really wanted one\n\n\nComing to a messy home is frustrating and having messy living space doesn't help with my psyche. It was just so difficult to make a decision as every big brands have x variations of the same \"model\" and they all seem to have similar features.... and most of the official websites don't really offer customer friendly comparison tool. so honestly I didn't know what to buy.\n\nAfter weeks of watching review/test videos on YT, lurking on this subreddit & Vacuum Wars. I decided to get mid-range robot vacuum while there is end of financial year sale (I'm in Australia) and the only way to get over analysis paralysis is to compare directly. \n\nMy initial budget was around $1200AUD so I shortlisted vacs around that price range and also included ones up to $1500ish if it was highly recommended by the reviewers (that didn't have \"paid promotions\").\n\nOnce I listed all the key features and specs, I highlighted the ones that stands out (top 2-3) and according to this analysis Dreame was the winner. I pondered buying L30 but really liked the extending side brush.\n\nI put it to the test as soon as I set it up, and it vacuumed and mopped almost perfectly! \nThe floor hasn't been mopped over 3 weeks so there were some parts that were still not  clean after initial vacuum&mop cycle so I ran it again for areas that still needed more rub. \n\nThe floor is a section of the living room where I had the most foot traffic so I ran 2 cycles.. I really cannot complain how well it did.\n\nOne thing I didn't realise was that it only has the extending brush on the right side and there's none on the left and it still vacuumed just fine.\n\nI've set up 2 daily cycles: vacuum only in the morning and vacuum+mop in the afternoon so the house would always be clean when I come home after work or when I finish wfh. \n\nI haven't tried cleaning on the carpet as I'll need to pick things up from the bedroom floor, I'll post an update when I run them in the bedrooms tomorrow or this weekend. I'm so happy that I finally bought one and it's doing a great job! ",

It's a big improvement on my old Xiaomi unit that was 5 years old and had no automation or mopping.\n\nIt vacuums fine for my expectation, and mops well too... although if you have a very dirty floor then I would say spot cleaning with paper towel would help the robot greatly. Bad spots take a lot of passes to deal with, and it's a bit silly IMO to not do a bit of manual spot cleaning. \n\nA few things I'd like to share. The L30 Ultra S seems a very new model, and it's NOT the L30 that pops up in small amounts of online info from the past. For example, it doesn't have hot water washing of mopping pads. However it does have 13000 suction (from memory) compared to about 7000.\n\nThe tri cut brush is $200 on Dreame au website. So if you need hair dealt with and need this extra brush, need to factor this in. \n\nI went with Dreame because of purported obstacles avoidance goodness, and so far pretty impressed. I haven't tried the sock test yet though, to see if it avoids kids socks. Those were the worst for my old bot. A sock would jam in the roller and then it would drag it all over the floor... resulting in a very dirty sock and a failed  clean of the floor (vacuum not taking in the dirt).\n\nI did note it didn't see a pencil. I wish it could. And lego pieces !\n\nIt also has occasional issues where i circles around empty floor - i think our high gloss  lacqured floor might be confusing thebinstacle avoidance. Rare and not really a problem as such.\n\nThe handling of the mat in the living area is though, and not sure what to do there yet. It takes a long time getting confused on the mat. Not sure why yet.\n\nLast comment about it- the quick mapping was pretty good BUT it doesn't run the vacuum while doing the mapping. So, if your floor is dirty it ends up dragging dirt around, and small things like mandarin seeds flying round inside the roller making awful noises. Why it doesn't just have the vacuum on during mapping is a strange decision. It wasn't a pleasant first use experience.  I had to intervene many times. \n\nWould love to hear how the L40S Ultra has done with hair ? (A friend is interested. )\n\nAnd Carpet! Do post :)\n\nFinally, I note the L40S Ultra is NOT the same as the L40. \n\nThe market is indeed overwhelming. The ridiculous range of models is nuts.",

We've had a [Roborock S5](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobotVacuums/comments/1kz11eb/free_roborock_s5_needs_a_repair_paying_it_forward/) since 2019 but replaced it after the LDS stopped being reliable. I bought the E25 for £700, direct from Eufy.\n\nSo very brief first impressions of the E25, after first setup and initial clean:\n\nSetup:\n\n* Box is bloody heavy. Be careful!\n* Setup is super slick and super easy - wifi connection and app setup was done in a few mins\n* The machine looks and feels well-built\n* The funny circular light under the clean water reservoir is annoying, and I wish it could be dimmed or turned off\n* The sticky labels on the top of the reservoirs (which explain how to use) have tabs as if they should be removed - but when you peel them off they leave yukky glue residue\n\nMapping:\n\n* Amazing initial mapping experience\n* It tracked all the rooms and identified some of them (e.g., it knew one room was a bathroom - presumably using the AI camera to identify the toilet)\n* The 3D map is cool, but pointless\n* I needed to set up a no-go area and virtual wall and the first time I set it up, this just failed (click 'save', message says 'Failed', and no other feedback). After I re-mapped the house, it worked fine. Probably an app or wifi comms bug.\n\nCleaning and vacuuming:\n\n* First clean took about an hour - 85m2, or so.\n* It's *very* quiet. Half the volume, or less, than the Roborock S5, which was a noisy sod.\n* Vacuuming seems very good - better than the S5 (but you'd expect so, as it has nearly 10x the suction Pa)\n* Mopping seemed good so far, and the water from cleaning was very muddy. Be interesting to see how much better the effect is when running regularly.\n* Overall clean was pretty good. There were a few tiny bits of debris missed in the corners under teh worktops, but I'm aware no robovac is perfect. Again, little and often\n* It did get stuck in a couple of places - one step was too high for it to get down (virtual wall placed to prevent this) and a narrow bit next to the toilet - it's about 8mm to wide to go all the way in, so I set up a no-go area. But avoidance generally seems good.\n\nOverall, very pleased. It'll be interesting to see how well it works once we've got the schedules running.\n\nEdit: one other plus. I was a bit concerned about the cost of bags for the base unit, but there's unofficial ones on amazon for about £14 for 10 bags, which seems reasonable. Better still, I went into the Eufy app tonight and it offered me a free gift in return for feedback. So I wrote some feedback and they gave a voucher for a free £16 pack of 3 official hoover bags. So at 75 days per bag, that'll last me at least until Christmas. ",

    "selftext": "Rumors have been circling that DJI is developing a Robot vacuum for YEARS, and now something concrete has officially surfaced: a photo of the ready to ship packaged products.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bh9bwz04nm3f1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=60cc7e3d8c797c62f6612ca778361fe7cf287a74\n\nhere is what we know about the product so far:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ij2ymfdiqm3f1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=4acdf35960683ee125ceaa79a3578605733bc659\n\n1. DJI's Robot vacuum is an **Omni All-in-One**, has a auto-self empty function as well as auto washing&drying.\n2. The APP has most of the smart features to its competitors: Mapping, AI cleaning, cleaning specific area, schedule time and cleaning.\n3. The product's main selling point would be on its obsticle avoidance capability, which contains 6 DoF sensors around its body.\n4. It doesn't use a lidar-tower, the navigation system would be similar to DJI drone's camera vision based ML BEV algorithm.\n5. It's priced at the higher end, touted as the \"most capable and reliable obsticle avoidence system\" ever made, it aims to go after comptitors such as dreame and roborock's computer vision based premier model.\n\n[A leaked photo of the rumored \\\\\"ROMO\\\\\" back in Oct, 24.](https://preview.redd.it/0f3pg2eqlm3f1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=137465b826f105947bcb5e48705ecd7eff7c5b4d)\n\nFinally, a little bit of trivia on how and why DJI entered the industry of Robot Vacuum.  \nBoth Narwal and DJI belong to the same group of entrepreneurs, the “XBotPark”, it primarily functions as an incubator, investing in a group of talented graduates from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, which both the owners graduated from. There was a period of time when Narwal wanted to inject better talents to the company and specifically lured DJI engineers over with lucrative offers, resulting in a significant conflict between the owners, it got so out of hand that the conflict was finally settled by XBotPark's founders. As the result of retaliation, DJI's founder Frank Wang set up a division of Robot Vacuum, thus began DJI's Robot Vacuum development as we know it.",

I recommend this combo model (and some other dreame/MOVA models) for fur because of the onboard fur compression feature that compresses the fur in the dustbin as it vacuums so it won’t get as clogged as easily. \n\nIf you want it to mop best, the MOVA z50 ultra is a great choice at 2199 AUD with the best mopping and will be the best roller mop for hair since the comb-shaped scrapers are best suited to deal with hair tangles.",

    "title": "Roborock Q10 S5 first impressions",
    "selftext": "I had been in the market for a robot vacuum for about a month when I finally decided to pull the trigger and buy the Roborock Q10 S5. \n\nI was looking for a low cost machine that did not have a self emptying dock. The other contender on my list was the MOVA S10. When the Q10 S5 was initially released, it was discounted to $319. I hesitated to buy it as I was hoping to see an online review, but before anybody reviewed the machine, the price had gone up to $399. Roborock reduced the price back to $319 as part of their memorial day sale, so I decided to take a risk and go ahead and purchase it without seeing any reviews. I bought the Roborock Q10 S5 directly from Amazon because they had the same sale pricing as the Roborock website, plus I got an 5% back because I used my Amazon prime Visa card.\n\nMy previous experience with robot vacuums was a Roomba 551 that I rescued from the trash and repaired, and a Roomba i3 which I bought secondhand.\n\nMy apartment is definitely robot vacuum friendly! It is approximately 900 ft.² It's split about 700 ft.² of vinyl plank and 200 ft.² of carpet. I have no children or pets, and I am bald with a shaved head. I took care to prepare my apartment for the vacuum with good cable management. All of my power cords are bundled up, and many of them are on top of the baseboards which keeps them out of reach of any robot vacuums. \n\nInitial set up was simple. I downloaded the app from the Apple App Store. I connected the app to Wi-Fi in my house, and I added the robot to the app by scanning a QR code which was located under the top cover. I put the charging station and the water resistant apron underneath a built-in shelf in my hallway so that the robot would be out of the way. The robot arrived with about 50% battery charge so I decided to let it do an initial mapping run without charging it. It took about 20 minutes to do the initial mapping. The app allowed me to then label each of the rooms that it automatically generated. I subdivided the large open space into a few smaller sections so that I could prioritize them for cleaning if needed. The map was accurate, although it looks like the LIDAR tried to include some of the areas beyond my living room windows into the map.\n\nFor the first run, I had the robot vacuum the entire house with maximum vacuum power and using a crisscross pattern to cover the flooring twice. I wasn't expecting the robot to pick up too much dirt because my apartment is clean and tidy, and I vacuum the carpet using a Miele vacuum with a powerhead. I was surprised when I dumped the contents of the bin on the floor! There was quite a bit of carpet fuzz, which wasn't too surprising because the carpets are brand new, but there was a tremendous amount of fine dust sucked up as well. Good job little robot!\n\nThe only problem that I had with vacuuming was that the robot got shipwrecked on my IKEA Poang chairs. In my last house, I solved this problem by putting some spacers under the legs of the Poang chair. I will 3-D print some risers to bring up the chair by about a half an inch which will solve the problem.\n\nAfter vacuuming, I left the robot charge overnight. The next day I filled water tank and allowed the robot to do a combination vacuum and mopping run with the vacuuming set to maximum and the water flow set to heavy. It took a while for the robot to completely wet the mopping pad. At first, there was just a thin wet stripe trailing behind the robot. As vacuuming and mopping progressed, the entire pad became wet. I don't think there's any reason for me to try to pre-wet the pad in anyway. I was happy with the results of mopping. I didn't watch to see if the pad retracted automatically over the carpets, but the carpets were not wet so I am assuming that it functioned properly. \n\nAfter vacuuming, a mopping was complete, I got down on the floor and wiped my bare hands on the vinyl planks. I couldn't feel even a hint of dust or grittiness. The floors felt great under my bare feet as well!\n\n I was impressed that the robot would operate so close to the walls without running into the baseboards. Also, the vision allowed it to see the door stoppers screwed into the wall and avoid those. I have a video, but I'm not sure how I can add it to this thread.\n\nSo far, I am completely satisfied with the performance of the robot vacuum. It was easy to set up, the app is intuitive, and it certainly sucked up quite a bit of dirt. The bin is easy to empty, and the water reservoir is easy to fill. My floors feel clean under my bare feet. The biggest surprise to me was that the robot didn't crash into anything. My old Roombas would definitely bounce off the walls and furniture all the time when they were doing a cleaning run, but this one just zipped around my apartment like it could see, which I guess it can what with LIDAR and a camera.\n\nI will update this post or make a new post on this sub Reddit if there are any problems or notable developments in the future.\n\ngood luck, have fun!\n\n\n",

I think maybe that low price was just for a few days initially, it’s now around $419. \n\nThe Q10 has more suction power and the vibrating mop pad were a nice upgrade. The only thing I don’t love is how difficult it is to get into the tank and to swap out the mop pad. \n\nThe Q8 with the docking station had the mop pad and the water tank facing the user and it was easy to access both without having to remove the robot from the docking station. \n\nWith the Q10 and the dock, you have to pull the robot out of the docking station to access the mop pad because it is on the dock side, and to remove the water tank, it doesn’t easily pop out of the robot from the user side. You need to left up the top lid, and then lift out the water tank.",

With that on mind, we narrowed our search to Roborock and Mova. We had considered Ecovacs top of the line model but was put off by the reliability ratings from users.\n\nWhat we prioritize most is, hardfloor vacuuming and mopping skills and the best automation possible with dock. Secondly, the app performance for responsiveness and granular controls. Don't really care about the robot vacuum needing to scale Mount Everest like obstacles (seriously why though...?) or voice assistants.\n\nWith this in mind which of the two robot vacuums would you recommend?
