# robot-vacuum-ranker
Tired of reading hundreds of conflicting reviews while shopping for a robot vacuum?   This tool scrapes real reviews from top retailers, extracts feature-specific insights (like suction, noise, reliability), and helps rank vacuums based on what *really* matters.  Built to solve my own problem. Still under active development.

## Setup
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Create `.env` file with your Reddit API credentials
3. Run `python reddit_scraper.py`
